# Rafael Guzm√°n - Professional porfolio

I'm Rafael, and I'm an RPA developer. I live in Mexico City, but I work on automation projects for companies worldwide.

I know how to handle all the stages of an automation project - process analysis, solution design, development, testing, and implementation - using several tools. However, my most valuable skill is my passion for sharing knowledge.

My intention with this portfolio is to show what I can do by presenting the personal projects I have worked on. Here you will find the same projects developed using four different tools:
- UiPath
- Automation Anywhere 360
- Blue Prism
- Workfusion

The purpose of these projects (rather than having ready-to-run processes) is to demonstrate my development abilities, so some of them require a previous setup to run. 

If you detect any bugs or want to share some improvement ideas or comments about my work, please be in touch using the means of contact below.
